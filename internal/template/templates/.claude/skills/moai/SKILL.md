## Intent Router

### Raw User Input

$ARGUMENTS

### Routing Instructions

[HARD] Route the Raw User Input above using the strict priority order below. Extract the FIRST WORD of the input for subcommand matching. All text after the subcommand keyword is CONTEXT to be passed to the matched workflow — it is NOT a routing signal and MUST NOT influence which workflow is selected.

## Execution Mode Flags (mutually exclusive)

- `--team`: Force Agent Teams mode for parallel execution
- `--solo`: Force sub-agent mode (single agent per phase)
- No flag: System auto-selects based on complexity thresholds (domains >= 3, files >= 10, or complexity score >= 7)

When no flag is provided, the system evaluates task complexity and automatically selects between team mode (for complex, multi-domain tasks) and sub-agent mode (for focused, single-domain tasks).

### Priority 1: Explicit Subcommand Matching

[HARD] Extract the FIRST WORD from the Raw User Input section above. If it matches any subcommand below (or its alias), route to that workflow IMMEDIATELY. Do NOT analyze the remaining text for routing — it is context for the matched workflow:

- **plan** (aliases: spec): SPEC document creation workflow
- **run** (aliases: impl): DDD/TDD implementation workflow (per quality.yaml development_mode)
- **sync** (aliases: docs, pr): Documentation synchronization and PR creation
- **project** (aliases: init): Project documentation generation
- **feedback** (aliases: fb, bug, issue): GitHub issue creation
- **fix**: Auto-fix errors in a single pass
- **loop**: Iterative auto-fix until completion marker detected
- **mx**: MX tag scan and annotation for codebase
- **review** (aliases: code-review): Code review with security and MX tag compliance
- **clean** (aliases: dead-code): Identify and safely remove dead code
- **codemaps**: Generate architecture documentation in `.moai/project/codemaps/`
- **coverage** (aliases: cov): Analyze test coverage and generate missing tests
- **e2e** (aliases: e2e-test): Create and run E2E tests


### Priority 2: SPEC-ID Detection

Only if Priority 1 did not match: Check if the Raw User Input contains a pattern matching SPEC-XXX (such as SPEC-AUTH-001). If found, route to the **run** workflow automatically. The SPEC-ID becomes the target for DDD/TDD implementation.

### Priority 3: Natural Language Classification

Only if BOTH Priority 1 AND Priority 2 did not match: Classify the intent of the ENTIRE Raw User Input as natural language. This priority is NEVER reached when the first word matches a known subcommand.

- Planning and design language (design, architect, plan, spec, requirements, feature request) routes to **plan**
- Error and fix language (fix, error, bug, broken, failing, lint) routes to **fix**
- Iterative and repeat language (keep fixing, until done, repeat, iterate, all errors) routes to **loop**
- Documentation language (document, sync, docs, readme, changelog, PR) routes to **sync** or **project**
- Feedback and bug report language (report, feedback, suggestion, issue) routes to **feedback**
- MX tag language (mx tag, annotation, code context, legacy annotate) routes to **mx**
- Implementation language (implement, build, create, add, develop) with clear scope routes to **moai** (default autonomous)

### Priority 4: Default Behavior

If the intent remains ambiguous after all priority checks, use AskUserQuestion to present the top 2-3 matching workflows and let the user choose.

If the intent is clearly a development task with no specific routing signal, default to the **moai** workflow (plan -> run -> sync pipeline) for full autonomous execution.

## Execution Directive

When this skill is activated, execute the following steps in order:

Step 1 - Parse Arguments:
Extract subcommand keywords and flags from the Raw User Input. Recognized global flags: --resume [ID], --seq, --ultrathink, --team, --solo. When --ultrathink is detected, activate Sequential Thinking MCP for deep analysis before execution.

Step 2 - Route to Workflow:
Apply the Intent Router (Priority 1 through Priority 4) to determine the target workflow. If ambiguous, use AskUserQuestion to clarify with the user.

Step 2.5 - Project Documentation Check:
Before executing plan, run, sync, fix, loop, or default workflows, verify project documentation exists by checking for `.moai/project/product.md`. If product.md does NOT exist, use AskUserQuestion to ask the user (in their conversation_language):

Question: Project documentation not found. Would you like to create it first?
Options:
- Create project documentation (Recommended): Generates product.md, structure.md, tech.md through a guided interview. This helps MoAI understand your project context for better results in all subsequent workflows.
- Skip and continue: Proceed without project documentation. MoAI will have less context about your project.

This check does NOT apply to: project, feedback subcommands.

[HARD] Beginner-Friendly Option Design:
All AskUserQuestion calls throughout MoAI workflows MUST follow these rules:
- The first option MUST always be the recommended choice, clearly marked with "(Recommended)" suffix
- Every option MUST include a detailed description explaining what it does and its implications

Step 3 - Load Workflow Details:
Read the corresponding workflows/<name>.md file for detailed orchestration instructions.

Step 4 - Read Configuration:
Load relevant configuration from .moai/config/config.yaml and section files as needed.

Step 5 - Initialize Task Tracking:
Use TaskCreate to register discovered work items with pending status.

Step 6 - Execute Workflow Phases:
Follow the workflow-specific phase instructions. Delegate all implementation to appropriate agents via Task(). Collect user approvals at designated checkpoints via AskUserQuestion.

Step 7 - Track Progress:
Update task status using TaskUpdate as work progresses (pending to in_progress to completed).

Step 8 - Present Results:
Display results to the user in their conversation_language using Markdown format.

Step 9 - Add Completion Marker:
When all workflow phases complete successfully, add the appropriate completion marker (`<moai>DONE</moai>` or `<moai>COMPLETE</moai>`).

Step 10 - Guide Next Steps:
Use AskUserQuestion to present the user with logical next actions based on the completed workflow.
